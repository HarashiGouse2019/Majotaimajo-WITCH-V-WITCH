  characterBackstory: Raven Lilac is an aspiring Witch who is a Crystal Magic User
    (a very rare Magic Attribute). She is dubbed "The Amethyst Witch" because of the
    color of crystal she shoots, which closely derives from Dark Magic. She's a fairly
    powerful Witch and has a high magic yield (how much magic she has). The Witch
    Cult that she's affiliated is "Soulmere", which is a cult very lenient when it
    comes to their members. There are also known for having the strongest witches
    aside from the Witch Cult Serrulata.
