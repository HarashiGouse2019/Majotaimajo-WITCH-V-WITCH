  characterBackstory: "Raven Lilac is an aspiring Witch who is a Crystal Magic User
    (a very rare Magic Attribute). She is dubbed \u201CThe Amethyst Witch\u201D because
    of the color of crystal she shoots, which closely derives from Dark Magic. She\u2019s
    a fairly powerful Witch and has a high magic yield (how much magic she has). The
    Witch Cult that she\u2019s affiliated is \u201CSoulmere\u201D, which is a cult
    very lenient when it comes to their members. There are also known for having the
    strongest witches aside from the Witch Cult Serrulata. She\u2019s one of the members
    who are closest to the stage of Equilibrium, a state in which the mind and soul
    of the magic user is perfectly balance between positive and negative thoughts
    and emotion, thus unlocking the user\u2019s full magic potential."
